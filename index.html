        <p><strong>Welcome!</strong> I am a PhD candidate at the University of California, Berkeley, specializing in plant community ecology and restoration ecology. My goal is to produce "usable" science to improve ecosystem management. I use a combination of long-term data analysis, population modeling and field experiments to this end. My dissertation focuses on temporal dynamics in grasslands, particularly working rangelands and serpentine grasslands.    </p>
