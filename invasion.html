        <h1>Biodiversity conservation</h1>
        <p>Pockets of California grasslands, such as serpentine outcrops and perennial-grass refugia, remain dominated by native species. I use a population-modeling approach to understand how interacting global change drivers affect the persistence of native species in these areas. </p>
        <p>Serpentine grasslands are typically dominated by endemic annual forbs but are occasionally invaded by non-native annual grasses. In collaboration with Professor Richard Hobbs I am using long-term demographic data to model these dynamics. We are discovering that native and non-native species become abundant for different reasons: native forbs are highly fit but also strongly self-limited, whereas non-native grasses have low potential growth rates but also minimal self-limitation. As a consequence, slight, rainfall-driven increases in the growth rate of non-native grasses can cause large spikes in their abundance. Fortunately for management, this indicates that long periods of drought can be leveraged to eradicate non-native populations. </p>
        <p>In contrast, in a separate collaboration with the East Bay Regional Park District, Dr. Loralee Larios and I are discovering that climate variability has the opposite implication for perennial grass conservation. Sustained drought reduces adult survival, which can facilitate conversion from perennial to annual-dominated grasslands. Here, interacting global change factors (extreme drought and widespread non-native species) may create a threshold dynamic that requires intensive intervention to prevent or reverse.</p>
